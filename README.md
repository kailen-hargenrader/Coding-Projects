# Coding-Projects
A bag full of fun coding projects

Welcome to my Github repo! 
This repo holds all my work from middle school, high school, personal projects, online courses, and more. 
Some of the work that I've done before this repo was not well documented, so it can't be shared here, but this repo is still a good indicator of my coding progress.

Keep in mind that the work here has been done in various languages with various packages. 
Each folder off of the main thread should contain work with the same packages, which will be listed in the title of the folder.
Any project folders within those folders will only contain additional files needed for specific projects, such as .csv or .txt files.
Instructions for downloading packages so that its possible to run my programs should be listed in a file within the folder containing programs using such packages.

Enjoy!
